#50 Shades of gray
First code golf challenge

#expected output
an image file with 50 20x20px squares of different shades of gray
image file will have to be viewable on a normal computer without any special tools. Can't have you write an external tool that reduces your code size ;)

#language
rust - thanks james

#limitations
only std libraries allowed
